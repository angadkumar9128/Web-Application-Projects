# Tetris Game Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS

The Tetris Game project is a web-based application designed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This classic puzzle game challenges players to strategically place falling tetrominoes to create complete horizontal lines, which then disappear, earning points for the player. The project demonstrates the use of fundamental web development technologies and principles, showcasing dynamic rendering, user interaction, and game logic implementation.

# Key Features:

1. Dynamic Game Board:

The game board is created using HTML and CSS, with JavaScript dynamically updating the board to reflect the falling tetrominoes. CSS styles are applied for visual appeal, creating a clean and engaging interface.

2. Tetromino Movement:

JavaScript is employed to control the movement of tetrominoes. Players can move pieces left, right, and down using keyboard controls, and rotate them to fit into desired positions. The logic for collision detection ensures tetrominoes interact realistically with the board and other pieces.

3. Line Clearing and Scoring:

The game includes functionality to detect and clear completed lines. When a line is formed, it disappears, and the pieces above it shift down. The player earns points for each cleared line, and the score is displayed in real-time.

4. Game Over Detection:

The application features game over detection, where the game ends if the tetrominoes stack up to the top of the game board. Players can then choose to restart the game.

5. Responsive Design:

The game is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience across different devices and screen sizes.

This project serves as an excellent example of integrating core web technologies to create an interactive and visually appealing application. It highlights skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and game development.

# Calculator Using JavaScript

The Calculator project is a simple yet functional web application that performs basic arithmetic operations. Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project showcases the creation of an intuitive and user-friendly interface for performing calculations.

# Key Features:

1. User Interface:

The calculator features a clean and minimalistic design with a display screen and buttons for digits, operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and special functions (clear, equals).

2. Interactive Buttons:

Each button is mapped to its respective function using JavaScript event listeners. When a button is pressed, the corresponding value or operation is displayed on the screen.

3. Arithmetic Operations:

The calculator can handle basic arithmetic operations, allowing users to perform calculations in real-time. JavaScript handles the logic for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

4. Clear Function:

A clear button is included to reset the calculator, allowing users to start fresh calculations at any time.

5. Responsive Design:

The calculator is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability on various devices and screen sizes.

This project highlights fundamental web development skills, including the creation of a functional user interface, event handling, and implementing logic for arithmetic operations. It's a practical demonstration of how to build interactive and useful web applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
